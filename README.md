Interactive Rating Component

This is an interactive rating component built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to select a rating from 1 to 5, submit their selection, and see a thank-you message displaying their chosen rating.

Features

Users can select a rating between 1 and 5.

The selected rating gets highlighted.

Clicking "Submit" displays a thank-you message with the chosen rating.

Prevents submission without selecting a rating.

Technologies Used

HTML: Structure of the rating component.

CSS: Styling and layout.

JavaScript: Handles user interactions and dynamic updates.

How It Works

The user clicks on a number (1-5), which gets highlighted.

When the "Submit" button is clicked:

If a rating is selected, it appears in the thank-you message.

If no rating is selected, an alert prompts the user to choose one.

The main rating section disappears, and the thank-you message appears.
